Catering Scheduling Problem / Operating System

# Programming language and IDE:
In this project, Visual Studio system was used and coded in C #. Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE).
# Project:
There is a party with 10 guests in my house. I've hired a waiter from a catering company to serve you. We have "börek", "cake" and "drink" to be consumed by my 10 guests. 
(30 boreks, 15 slices of cake and 30 glasses of drink)
On the table, there are 3 trays for them, each has a capacity of 5 (5 boreks on borek tray, 5 slices of cake on cake tray and 5 glasses of drink on drink tray).
As the guests eat and drink, a waiter will fill the trays (when there is 0 or 1 left on the tray)
Every guest must eat and drink from all types of food and drink at least once.
A guest can eat max 5 boreks and drink 5 glasses of drink, but can eat only 2 slices of cake.
This will last until all food and drink is consumed.
